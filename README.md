# BuiltIt (Backyard Hack)

## ðŸ’¡ Project Details

The U.S. produces 268 million tons of trash annually. Most of them are composed of recyclable items. Our team members agonized about how to reduce environmental pollution caused by trash. Encouraging people to reduce their consumption of recyclable waste does not have much effect. We focused on the fact that each individual's actions according to their own rational plans can achieve socially desirable outcomes. People can experience the direct benefits of generating revenue without much cost burden and the indirect benefits of helping society and protecting the environment.

## :eyes: What it does


## :runner: How we built it
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, ReactJS, Bootstrap
- Database: Firebase
- Authentication: Auth0
- Deploying and hosting a website using Heroku

## :fire: Use of Firebase
- We have used Firebase as a database. We stored user's data, all the items from users into Firebase

## :closed_lock_with_key: Use of Auth0
- We have used Auth0 for secure user authentication and send data to Firebase to store for user's items

# Installing
## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
